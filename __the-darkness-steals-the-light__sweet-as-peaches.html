It looks more like a fox to me.” Whispers, <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#king-eiden">King Eiden</a> in reply.</p><p>“A fox? Since when does a fox have rabbit ears?”</p><p>“Since when is a cloud an animal?”</p><p><a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#nuria">Nuria</a> rests her head in the nook of <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#king-eiden">King Eiden</a>’s shoulder. She peers through her long, silky black hair, looks deep into the king’s eyes, and plants a longing kiss on his aging cheek. “You’ve caught the sun. The touch of summer suits you.”</p><p>“True enough, these fine summer days do wonders for old bones.” <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#king-eiden">King Eiden</a> strokes <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#nuria">Nuria</a>’s hair.</p><p>“Then let’s stay for a while longer, at least until the first snow.” <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#nuria">Nuria</a> stretches out, her long legs wrapping around the king. The lovers embrace beneath the creaking trees. She runs a playful foot up Eiden’s green silks.</p><p>“Snow. In <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#thiel">Thiel</a>? Winter’s kiss doesn’t come this far west, not for over fifty great cycles. Winter’s embrace is for the east, and <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#galt">Galt</a> will be buried in snow soon enough.”</p><p>“Ah, snow. I’ve heard so much about it, but I’ve never seen a single drop of it.” <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#nuria">Nuria</a>’s playful foot wanders to Eiden’s crotch.</p><p>“Snowflake, my love. Snow stretching as far as the eye can see. Deep as the clouds.”</p><p>“Sounds romantic.” <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#nuria">Nuria</a> purrs into the king’s ear. “I have visions of magnificent castles sitting on soft pillows of white with roaring fires and cozy nights.”&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#nuria">Nuria</a> takes a big, squelching bite from a juicy peach. The sweet juices run down her chin as she sucks her sticky fingers. “We can huddle together for warmth and make a child. If I am to bear an heir, then we best make the most of this long winter.”</p><p>“Keep your voice down, my love. I’m sure the men have heard enough of our endeavors.” <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#king-eiden">King Eiden</a> glances to the corners of the <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#orchard-glade">orchard glade</a>, where his armed guards stand on the edge of earshot, carrying long pike head spears that shine like gold in the autumnal sun.</p><p>“Endeavors? Am I such a chore?” <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#nuria">Nuria</a>’s thick eyebrows rise in skepticism. “Such a laborious affair. I am not so innocent. It is expected of me to bear an heir.”</p><p>“Aye, it’s expected. Every lord, man, woman, and child will wait for the news once we’re wed." Eiden gives a gruff cough.</p><p>“Then we should hasten with our activities. Unless, of course, your weary old bones can’t cope with such a bothersome chore.” <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#nuria">Nuria</a>’s hand drifts to Eiden’s rising crotch.</p><p>“It is no chore; of that, I can assure you. My love, we go back to uncertain times. I do not doubt our love. I doubt how my people will receive us.” <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#king-eiden">King Eiden</a> stares up at the carefree sky with troubled eyes.</p><p>“You’re having second thoughts?” <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#nuria">Nuria</a>’s words quiver in a whisper.</p><p>“No.” Eiden runs his hands through <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#nuria">Nuria</a>’s silken hair. “You have given me life, <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#nuria">Nuria</a>.” <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#king-eiden">King Eiden</a> sits up, his words trailing off as <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#nuria">Nuria</a> nuzzles and kisses his neck. “We have peace with <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#thiel">Thiel</a>, but back in <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#galt">Galt</a>, trouble stirs.”&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#king-eiden">King Eiden</a> looks down on <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#nuria">Nuria</a> and rests a comforting hand on her slender back. “I received troubling news.” <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#king-eiden">King Eiden</a> reaches into his silk robes and plucks a small piece of parchment. “Lords and lands have been falsely claimed; <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#madon">Madon</a> is making a bold move for the throne. My love. <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#galt">Galt</a> is no longer safe. We are not like these fine Thielian’s with polite treaties. <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#galt">Galt</a> is a scattered kingdom, with lords spread from the borderlands to the mountains of <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#kazuk">Kazuk</a>.”</p><p><a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#nuria">Nuria</a> gives a petulant shrug and purses her plump lips.</p><p>More father to daughter, Eiden brushes a finger over <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#nuria">Nuria</a>’s soft cheek. “Before these better times, <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#galt">Galt</a> was divided into seven warring kingdoms. Each with a claim for the other. We suffered generations of bloodshed, war, famine, and slaughter. It was my grandfather who finally brought peace. It was under his rule that <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#galt">Galt</a> found a way to live together. My father united <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#galt">Galt</a> in war, and in my rule, I finally found peace with <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#thiel">Thiel</a>. But at what cost? My own kingdom? I’ve wasted too much time in <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#thiel">Thiel</a> and neglected <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#galt">Galt</a>.”</p><p><a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#nuria">Nuria</a>’s eyes blaze with a woman’s cold fury. “Is that what I am? A waste of time.” Her words spit like venom from a snake.&nbsp;</p><p>“That’s not what I meant.” Eiden barks back in agitation. “You are the best of me, <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#nuria">Nuria</a>. I will not risk your safety and gamble with the safety of a future child, the future heir of <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#galt">Galt</a>.”</p><p><a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#nuria">Nuria</a> sits up in silence as her eyes blaze with growing fury.</p><p>“I must return to <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#galt">Galt</a> with all haste. There is too much at risk, and I will not risk your life for my foolishness.” Eiden runs both hands through his hair and stares down at his heavy, dull crown sitting in the grass. “If the lord’s support <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#madon">Madon</a>’s claim, then—</p><p>“Then what?” <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#nuria">Nuria</a> snaps.</p><p>“Then perhaps it’s for the best.”</p><p>“My love. My king. What do you mean?” A wide-eyed look of surprise hits <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#nuria">Nuria</a> like an unexpected slap.</p><p>“Like I said, for the best.” A hard, resigned grimace falls on Eiden’s face. All youthfulness evaporates, and sitting before <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#nuria">Nuria</a> is a frail old man. “If all the voting lords support <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#madon">Madon</a>, then it is better to have peace than war. I can’t hold the kingdom without the accession council’s full support; I’ll have no choice but to abdicate.” Eiden slaps his lap in frustration. “If <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#madon">Madon</a> upholds the alliance with <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#thiel">Thiel</a> along with my terms, then I may be able to abdicate the throne without bloodshed.”</p><p>“Then we are not destined to be king and <em>queen</em>?” <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#nuria">Nuria</a> watches her dream evaporate before her eyes.</p><p>“I wish I could tell you.” Eiden places <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#nuria">Nuria</a>’s dainty hands between his own old bear paws, their fingers intertwining.</p><p>“Then let us stay. Forget your troubles. Talk with <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#king-adal">King Adal</a> and remain in the safety of <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#thiel">Thiel</a>.”</p><p>“I am the King of <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#galt">Galt</a>,” Eiden cuts in, “I will return to my kingdom and do what I must. We leave at sunrise, and you will remain in <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#thiel">Thiel</a> until spring.”</p><p>“So, this is your command, my love?” <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#nuria">Nuria</a> hisses like an angry cat.</p><p>“<a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#nuria">Nuria</a>, it’s settled. <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#king-adal">King Adal</a> has granted you a place in his court, under his protection. <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#queen-aina">Queen Aina</a> will teach you the intricacies of court and introduce you to <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#thiel">Thiel</a>’s elite social circles. We hope you and <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#queen-aina">Queen Aina</a> will forge a strong bond of friendship. It is all agreed upon. Adal will provide a small regiment of his own household guard for your personal safety.”</p><p>“So, I am to be a bargaining chip in your games?” <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#nuria">Nuria</a> slumps, defeat washing over her. “How long have you known?”</p><p>“I made the plan last turn. I will decide on Adal’s new union in the spring when I return. We will speak no more about this.”</p><p>“As you command, my king.” <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#nuria">Nuria</a> lifts her head and forces a feigned joyous smile. “Guards,” <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#nuria">Nuria</a> says, rising to her feet and clapping her hands twice. “Come, drink with us, for you are to return home. Let us celebrate this day. Let us drink into the evening. It is the tradition from my homeland to never say farewell on dry lips.”</p><p>“What are you doing?” <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#king-eiden">King Eiden</a> rises to his feet.</p><p>The circle of guards turns to face the couple.</p><p>“I am doing what needs to be done, my king.” <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#nuria">Nuria</a> dances before Eiden with mischievous sidesteps. “If this is our farewell, then let it be happy memories. Let us remember this night.”</p><p>“As you wish, my queen.” Eiden bows to <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#nuria">Nuria</a> and links her arm. “Come, men of <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#galt">Galt</a>, you have been away from your loved ones for too long. Tonight, feast and drink with us. At the rising of the sun, Eiden pauses for effect, beaming a youthful grin from his withering, aged face. “We ride for home.” A half-hearted cheer emerges from the guards as they approach with hesitant steps.</p><p>One guard winces as he speaks, his clumsy words tumbling from his lips. “We ain’t used to drinking with the king and his, uh, queen. We’re on duty.”</p><p>“Nonsense. The king commands it from you. Isn’t that right, my love?” <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#nuria">Nuria</a>’s eyes fix on Eiden with an uncompromising stare.</p><p><a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#king-eiden">King Eiden</a> contains his agitation. “Men of <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#galt">Galt</a>, you are relieved from duty until the rising of the sun. Come, drink, and make merry with us.”</p><p>The guards lay their pike head spears on the soft green grass. “As you command, my king.”</p><p><a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#nuria">Nuria</a> snatches a goblet of wine from the grass. She takes a long swig and then drains the cup dry. She tips the cup upside down for effect. Not a single drop falls from the goblet’s lip. “I fear we will need more wine, and lots of it.” <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#nuria">Nuria</a> rolls her accent with a purr. “Servant, don’t just stand there. Go fetch more wine.”</p><p>At the edge of the orchard, a young olive-skinned serving girl bows and scurries back into the main <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#villa">villa</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#king-eiden">King Eiden</a> forces an awkward smile. “<a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#captain-aiwelf">Captain Aiwelf</a>,” a tall guard steps forward, “you will remain in <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#thiel">Thiel</a> with <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#nuria">Nuria</a>. You must always be by her side. Should you encounter trouble, you may speak directly to <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#king-adal">King Adal</a>.”</p><p>“As you command, my king, I will protect Lady <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#nuria">Nuria</a> with my life.” Aiwelf gives a deep bow to Lady <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#nuria">Nuria</a>.</p><p>“I know you will.” Eiden can’t hide his relief. “I trust you with all that I hold most dear.” <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#captain-aiwelf">Captain Aiwelf</a> nods. “Ensure we are ready to leave before sunrise. We ride to the border of <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#ossan">Ossan</a> escorted by the king’s own regiment. Ensure your men are fit to ride.”</p><p>“Forgive me, my king. Is it wise for the men to spend the evening drinking?” <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#captain-aiwelf">Captain Aiwelf</a> lowers his gaze away from Eiden.</p><p>“Wise? No, but your queen has spoken. Attend to your duties.” <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#king-eiden">King Eiden</a> attempts to hide his weary sigh.</p><p>“As you command, my king.” <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#captain-aiwelf">Captain Aiwelf</a>’s unwavering eyes linger on <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#nuria">Nuria</a>, then he turns and strides toward the stables.</p><span >

The men of <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#galt">Galt</a> sing and dance with carefree abandon, arm in arm, swaying and singing up to the night sky.</p><div ><em>“Oh, favored love. On this fine night, Oh, lass of <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#galt">Galt</a>. So strong and fine. On this fine night, you are mine. How long will this love last? Only as long as I can stick my cock up your pretty ass.”</em></div><p>“Men of <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#galt">Galt</a>, you have such a fine way with words.” <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#nuria">Nuria</a> rolls on the grass in giddy, intoxicated laughter, her legs exposed beneath her fine silk that blows open in the breeze.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#king-eiden">King Eiden</a> hangs his head at the crassness of his guards. “Now, let me fetch more wine; I want a taste of home.”</p><p>The guards give a loud roar of approval and thud back onto the grass on drunken arses. <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#king-eiden">King Eiden</a> peers at <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#nuria">Nuria</a> with narrow-eyed suspicion.</p><p>“What? Perhaps you and your men will be so drunk, you will not leave my side.” <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#nuria">Nuria</a> stifles a sob.</p><p>Eiden winces and sips at his wine in silence.</p><p>“Gentlemen.” <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#nuria">Nuria</a> stands tipsy, swaying from side to side. “Let me find my favorite drop. It’s from my vineyard, the finest in <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#aradesh">Aradesh</a>. A taste of home for a final farewell.”</p><p>The servant girl steps forward from the shadows of the orchard with a bowed head. “Lady <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#nuria">Nuria</a>, I will bring the wine you seek.”</p><p>“I could do with the walk. You may accompany me.” The servant nods and lowers her submissive gaze as <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#nuria">Nuria</a> totters on drunken feet from the bright moonlit glade.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#nuria">Nuria</a> stumbles out of sight, and her wayward steps become sure-footed, sober strides. The servant follows behind at a respectful distance. <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#nuria">Nuria</a> comes to a standstill and whispers over her shoulder. “Sister, it is time.”</p><p>“He suspects you. He is no fool.” The servant hisses back in a whispered response.</p><p>“Maybe, but we are out of time.” <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#nuria">Nuria</a> stares up at the stars. “Just be ready, <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#amelia">Amelia</a>.”</p><p>“Are you sure about this, <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#nuria">Nuria</a>? You’re playing a dangerous game.”</p><p>“Shut up and fetch the bloody wine.” <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#nuria">Nuria</a> barks back her response.</p><p>The servant girl, <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#amelia">Amelia</a>, strides towards the <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#villa">villa</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#nuria">Nuria</a> takes a deep, settling breath.</p><p>“Lady <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#nuria">Nuria</a>?” The voice catches her off guard as she spins to face <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#captain-aiwelf">Captain Aiwelf</a>. He peers at <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#nuria">Nuria</a> with a look of concern through the shadowy darkness.</p><p>“<a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#captain-aiwelf">Captain Aiwelf</a>, you startled me.” <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#nuria">Nuria</a> rests a playful hand on his broad chest. Her fingers play with his buttons as she gathers her wits. “Do you not drink with your own men?”</p><p>“Not all men drink, my lady." Aiwelf musters a solemn grin. “I serve better when sober and haven’t touched a drop since my twentieth great cycle.”</p><p>“Well then, captain, who am I to turn you into a drunk, but will you not share in a parting toast with your king?”</p><p>“Forgive me, my lady.” Aiwelf nods with careful politeness. “My father was a drinker, and my mother felt his fist too often. I won’t touch a drop of the stuff.” He brushes <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#nuria">Nuria</a>’s hand away from his chest. “<a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#king-eiden">King Eiden</a> knows this only too well, and he will not ask it of me.”</p><p>“Then, captain, I suggest you resume your duties.” <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#nuria">Nuria</a> turns her back to the captain.</p><p>“I bid you goodnight, my lady.” <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#captain-aiwelf">Captain Aiwelf</a> turns and walks with long strides through the shadowy garden back towards the stables.</p><p><a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#nuria">Nuria</a> puffs out a deep, withheld breath and glances back up at the radiant sky. She walks in small circles, letting the breeze brush against her face and blow through her hair.</p><p>“I told you, he suspects you.”</p><p><a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#nuria">Nuria</a> spins to face her sister, who holds a silver pitcher of wine. “I thought you meant Eiden.”</p><p>“No, Eiden can’t see past your tits and sweet cunt.” The servant girl cackles with low, mirthful laughter.</p><p><a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#nuria">Nuria</a> rolls her eyes.</p><p>“If only <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#coilette">Coilette</a> could see you.” The servant girl gives a mock pout, holding her breasts and beating her eyelashes. “Oh, men of <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#galt">Galt</a>. Spit roast me in under the moon's silver light. The shame you bring to our family name.”</p><p>“Shut up, <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#amelia">Amelia</a>.” <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#nuria">Nuria</a> ties her silk gown tighter and glowers at her sister. “Now hold still.” She reaches inside her low-cut silk gown and rummages for a concealed pocket, then emerges with a glass vial of clear liquid.</p><p>“Is it enough?” <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#amelia">Amelia</a> peers at the tiny vial, skeptical.</p><p><a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#nuria">Nuria</a> spins the vial between her delicate, manicured fingers. “Enough to knock out a stable of horses.” She pops the cork from the vial and pours the liquid into the pitcher of sweet red wine.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#nuria">Nuria</a>’s sister, <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#amelia">Amelia</a>, gives the pitcher a slight swirl and passes back it to <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#nuria">Nuria</a>. “You know what must be done. You must be swift. If questioned, you are running a personal errand of high importance.”</p><p>“I know what to do. It’s not the first time, nor will it be the last.” <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#amelia">Amelia</a> rolls her eyes at her sister and asks, "What of the captain?”</p><p>“He’s only one man. Won’t be the first, won’t be the last.” <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#nuria">Nuria</a> shrugs.</p><p><a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#amelia">Amelia</a> turns and walks into the night, towards the stables.</p><p><a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#captain-aiwelf">Captain Aiwelf</a> spies the unfolding deeds from the deepest shadows of the orchard.</p><p>The boisterous soldiers of <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#galt">Galt</a> laugh and dance as the drum beats into a frenzy. They sway as one, singing for their king.</p><div ><em>“Glorious <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#galt">Galt</a>. We stand tall. We stand proud. We stand as one. Victorious for all our days. We will remain. Men of <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#galt">Galt</a>.

A final toast, and then let us retreat to our private farewells.”</p><p><a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#king-eiden">King Eiden</a> conceals his blush as his guards raise their inebriated brows.</p><p><a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#nuria">Nuria</a> fills the empty goblets with wine. In the distance, on the vaguest edge of hearing, hooves trip-trap on the courtyard floor and then break into a gallop.&nbsp;</p><p>The guards’ ears prick, but <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#nuria">Nuria</a> raises her empty goblet to toast. “To <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#galt">Galt</a>. Strong, proud, and free. To <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#king-eiden">King Eiden</a>.”</p><p>The guards empty their cups, chugging down the wine and toasting their king. Eiden drains his cup dry.</p><p>“Forgive me, men of <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#galt">Galt</a>.” <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#nuria">Nuria</a> wraps her arm around the king’s. “I must bid you farewell and retire, for our last hours are precious.”</p><p><a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#nuria">Nuria</a> tugs at Eiden to leave, and together they stroll into the <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#villa">villa</a>.</p><p>The guards sit down, slumped together beneath the sweet peach tree.</p></div></div></div></div>
