Shadows retreat, and the wind becomes still. <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#the-oasis">The oasis</a> pool glistens like a jewel under the morning sun. </p><p>“Blast this infernal heat.” <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#jain">Jain</a> emerges from the oracle’s tent, shielding his eyes from the rising sun. “What bloody time is it?” He mutters.</p><p>“We’re approaching the far west. <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#thiel">Thiel</a> is a full turn behind our time, the Great Moon at its peak and dawn but a distant dream,” <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#lord-varesh">Lord Varesh</a> rubs his sleepless eyes.</p><p>“Isn’t it beautiful?” <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#danan">Danan</a> walks behind <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#jain">Jain</a> toward the sparkling oasis pool.</p><p>“Beautiful?” <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#jain">Jain</a> mutters with disdain. “I can think of many words to describe this sand hole, and ‘beautiful’ is not one of them. Diseased inbred filth—" <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#jain">Jain</a> curses under his breath.</p><p>“Careful, <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#jain">Jain</a>. We are still welcome guests and under <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#anut">Anut</a>’s protection.” Varesh shoots <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#jain">Jain</a> a silencing glare.</p><p>“Easy for you to say, Oh, Great Elim.” <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#jain">Jain</a> mutters with sarcasm. He kicks at the sand, which blows straight back into his own face. “They didn’t try feeding you their tit milk all night. I didn’t know if they wanted to feed me, fuck me, or eat me alive.”&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#jain">Jain</a> crouches and places his hands on his knees, his eyes bloodshot. “That bird thing tried to, you know—" <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#jain">Jain</a> starts dry-retching, fighting back the urge to vomit. “She wanted me to father her a —.” <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#jain">Jain</a>’s voice trails off into a whisper. “She spread those little duck legs, and —" A thick glob of thick milky vomit splatters onto the sands.</p><p>“I recall you were more than happy with the audience.” <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#danan">Danan</a> pats <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#jain">Jain</a>’s back and helps him stand.&nbsp;</p><p>“Where are the camels?” <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#danan">Danan</a> scans the sprawling camp with a quizzical gaze. “Where are all the brothers?”</p><p>“On a hunt.” <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#lord-varesh">Lord Varesh</a> removes his sandals and strides barefoot towards <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#the-oasis">the oasis</a> pool, his bright yellow robes fluttering in behind him.</p><p>“A hunt?” <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#jain">Jain</a> rubs his newly formed stubble. “A hunt for what? There’s nothing here but sand.”</p><p>“It’s best you don’t know.” <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#lord-varesh">Lord Varesh</a>’s icy eyes sweep the silent camp as he speaks. “There are at least three dozen brothers, and they seek a prize for their hungry sister brides. So, let us hasten.”&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#lord-varesh">Lord Varesh</a> gestures toward a long, narrow dugout canoe in <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#the-oasis">the oasis</a> pool. “Don’t just stand there. Get in.” Impatient, he clambers into the tight-fitting dugout.</p><p>“How did you know this canoe would be here?” Asks <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#danan">Danan</a>.</p><p>“<a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#nubina">Nubina</a> provided it,” <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#lord-varesh">Lord Varesh</a> replies, a little sharply.</p><p><a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#danan">Danan</a> follows Varesh into the dugout, rocking it violently from side to side. He grabs a carved paddle resting on the canoe’s base.</p><p>“Who is <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#nubina">Nubina</a>?” <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#danan">Danan</a> asks, trying to make himself comfortable in the narrow dugout.</p><p><a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#jain">Jain</a> pushes the canoe from <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#the-oasis">the oasis</a> edge and into the pool. It slides from the sandbank and comes to float. He takes a cumbersome step into the rear of the canoe when a curved ngbaka blade comes to rest at his neck.</p><p>“Not so fast, moon skin,” a voice hisses in his ear. “Wait for me, <em>Lord</em> <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#jain">Jain</a> of House Adair.” The cold crescent blade pulls away from <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#jain">Jain</a>’s throat.</p><p>“Welcome, <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#nubina">Nubina</a>,” <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#lord-varesh">Lord Varesh</a> says with a welcoming smile. “I didn’t see you, although I knew you would be close. We must go, and with all haste.” <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#lord-varesh">Lord Varesh</a> gives her an urgent nod.</p><p>A forceful hand pushes <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#jain">Jain</a> into the back, and he turns on his knees to face a woman. His words of rebuke fall silent as his mouth hangs open in speechless amazement.</p><p><a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#nubina">Nubina</a>, black as sculpted polished granite, glistens with a sheen of sweat. Her penetrating eyes, a striking shade of otherworldly blue, stare at him with unwavering intensity. Braided, jet-black hair cascades down her shoulders in intricate braids adorned with a golden ring that hangs from a headband, accentuating her proud forehead.</p><p>“Are you sure about this one?” <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#nubina">Nubina</a> peers down at <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#jain">Jain</a> as she slides into the dugout.</p><p>Her athletic shoulders transition into narrow yet powerful arms; the upper body reveals sizable breasts secured by a strapped kaducu tied behind her neck. A long, colorful skirt drapes down her front and rear, contrasting with the exposed jet-black legs that ripple with powerful muscles. An arched blade resembling a giant throwing knife dangles from her belt, its crescent shape forming a razor-sharp half-moon. At the tip of the arch, another blade spikes outward.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#nubina">Nubina</a> slips her second ngbaka blade into her belt and throws <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#jain">Jain</a> a wink.</p><p><a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#jain">Jain</a> sits speechless, bewitched by her beauty.</p><p><a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#nubina">Nubina</a> grasps a paddle and punts it from <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#the-oasis">the oasis</a> pool and into a shallow stream. The dugout drags on the sandy bottom as she uses the paddle to punt them into deeper waters.</p><p><a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#jain">Jain</a> averts his ogling glance from her legs and looks to the dugout floor.</p><p>“Who are you?” <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#danan">Danan</a> finds his voice.</p><p>“Quiet <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#danan">Danan</a>,” <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#nubina">Nubina</a> says, scanning the banks of <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#the-oasis">the oasis</a> stream. “Now is not the time for chatter. The brothers hunt a caravan of silk traders. Easy pickings for fresh meat.” She lingers on the last word and gives <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#jain">Jain</a> a stare, who fidgets with one of his concealed daggers.</p><p>“But how did you know we’d be here?” <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#danan">Danan</a> hisses in a frantic whisper.</p><p>“I came at nightfall. You cannot trust those who dwell at the mouth of the <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#hebend-basin">Hebend Basin</a>.” She gestures to the river. “From the shadows, I observed many things.” She stares at <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#jain">Jain</a>, who hides from her perceptive stare. “I heard many things, for I am silent as the sands and can be as close as your own shadow.”</p><p><a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#danan">Danan</a> scratches at his head, his brow furrowing. “But who are you?”</p><p>“This is <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#nubina">Nubina</a>. She is our guide, master monk,” <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#lord-varesh">Lord Varesh</a> whispers from the rear of the dugout, his searching eyes not leaving the stream’s bank.</p><p>“Guide to where?” <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#danan">Danan</a> can’t hide the excitement in his voice.</p><p>“Later, <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#danan">Danan</a>.” The arid red desert gives way to sporadic thickets of bright green plants and looming trees. “I sent <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#nubina">Nubina</a> a message before we left <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#thiel">Thiel</a>. She’s been waiting for us.”</p><p>“You sent a bird over the ocean?” Dumbfounded, <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#danan">Danan</a> almost squeaks.</p><p>“Don’t be ridiculous.” The mage scoffs. “<a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#nubina">Nubina</a> is of the Elema. We have no need for birds. Now hush. Let us hope we go unbothered through these waters.”</p><p>“Elema? What is going on? Ouch.”&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#jain">Jain</a> prods <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#danan">Danan</a> in the ribs and places a shushing finger to his own lips, nodding to shapes stalking them through the undergrowth on the left bank.&nbsp;</p><p>The sandy bank of the desert becomes thick with brush. The gentle stream gives way to fast-flowing waters, which broaden into a rushing river. <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#danan">Danan</a> sits, staring in silent awe at the unfolding exotic world. The riverbanks become dense with impossibly tall trees. Monkeys chatter, bound, and call in <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#the-jungle">the jungle</a>’s canopy. Bright tropical birds chirp unknown songs, and small crocodiles loiter on the sandbanks. <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#danan">Danan</a>’s eyes widen in horror as a crocodile darts with a splash into the waters beside him.</p><p>“Don’t worry, they’re just babies. It’s the mothers you watch out for.” <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#nubina">Nubina</a>’s head gestures to what looks like a floating log. The yellow eyes blink and then slink beneath the water’s surface.</p><p>“How do you know my name?” <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#danan">Danan</a> gives <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#nubina">Nubina</a> a puzzled glance.</p><p>“I know many things about you, <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#danan">Danan</a>.” She looks to <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#jain">Jain</a>, who reclines in unusual silence. “I know many things about you too, Lord <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#jain">Jain</a> Adair.”</p><p><a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#jain">Jain</a> fidgets with his dagger but doesn’t meet her stare.</p><p><a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#the-jungle">The jungle</a> canopy arches overhead as monkeys clamber and leap from one side of the river to the other. “The outcasts won’t venture this far down the river.” <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#nubina">Nubina</a> ceases paddling and lets the dugout drift on the Hebend’s current. She glances at <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#lord-varesh">Lord Varesh</a>. “It’s a dangerous game to trade with <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#anut">Anut</a>. You got it then?” Excitement resonates in her voice.</p><p>“I got it,” <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#lord-varesh">Lord Varesh</a> says, revealing a small roll of parchment concealed within his robe. “I’m as surprised as you,” he admits, “and grateful that <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#anut">Anut</a> is as wise as she professes to be. Hidden within those tomes lies a slender chance of her rebirth. A hope even she cannot deny.”</p><p>“Do you trust her?” <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#nubina">Nubina</a> inquires with a sardonic snarl.</p><p>“Trust, <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#anut">Anut</a>?” The mage scoffs. “Never.” He settles into the rear of the dugout and skims his hand on the water’s surface. “I trust <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#anut">Anut</a> as little as I trust these waters. However, <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#anut">Anut</a> is no fool. I gave her the rarest grimoires of all the kingdoms. The irony of knowing everything about everyone, yet her own existence, remains a mystery to her.”</p><p>Varesh tucks the parchment back in his robes with an appreciative nod. “The hunt is on.” He slaps his legs with joy and guffaws in merry laughter.</p><p>“Alright,” <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#jain">Jain</a> finally breaks his silence. “What in the Thirteen Hells is going on?”</p><p>“Ah, there you are. I was thinking you’d lost your tongue.” Varesh remarks, winking at <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#nubina">Nubina</a>.</p><p>“My mind was elsewhere.” <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#jain">Jain</a> gives <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#nubina">Nubina</a> a slight glance before averting his gaze. "Like, who was stalking us when we left that freak show in the middle of the desert?”</p><p>“You’ve got keen ears, moon-flesh.” <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#nubina">Nubina</a> nods approvingly.</p><p>“Moon flesh?” <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#jain">Jain</a> snorts.</p><p>“Yes, pale man.” <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#nubina">Nubina</a>’s eyes sparkle with amusement. “You’ve got flesh as pale as moonlight.” She purses her lips. “I’ll call you 'Moon Boy'.”</p><p>“Boy?” <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#jain">Jain</a> puffs out, “I’m a man. A lord.”</p><p><em>"Ladies, I am Lord <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#jain">Jain</a> Adair from the Kingdom of <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#thiel">Thiel</a>." </em><a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#nubina">Nubina</a> gives him a mocking bow and mimics his voice. “I heard your amorous charms with the sisters.”</p><p>“What?

She gives him a disdainful sniff. “You stink of foul breast milk and rotten man meat. Out here, you’re just a child. You know nothing of my world or my kind.”&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#nubina">Nubina</a> sits again, resting her back in the dugout. “You wouldn’t last a day in <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#the-jungle">the jungle</a>. It will swallow you whole, silent as the night, deadly as poison. “My name in our tongue is <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#nubina">Nubina</a>, which means ‘black poison’.” She looks away from an abashed <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#jain">Jain</a> toward <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#danan">Danan</a>. “Not all of <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#anut">Anut</a>’s children are so hospitable.” She spits into the river. “One son for one daughter.” <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#nubina">Nubina</a> shakes her head in disgust. “Inbred sand flies.”</p><p><a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#jain">Jain</a> snorts a laugh in approval.</p><p>“They cast those deemed excess to roam the red lands.

Time slips away as swiftly as the tide. Unanswered questions wait for calmer waters.</p><p><a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#nubina">Nubina</a> breaks the tranquil calm and paddles them to a wide sandy riverbank surrounded by thick jungle. “We’ll make camp here.” She jumps from the dugout in a single, graceful leap onto the shore and pulls the canoe onto the wet sandbank.</p><p><a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#jain">Jain</a> stands and helps <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#danan">Danan</a> to his feet.

There’s plenty of dry wood and tinder near the base of the trees.” With that, she steps into the dense jungle. “Watch out for the fire ants. Once they bite, you must burn them off before the poison sets in.” She glances back at them, looking over her shoulder through the thick undergrowth. “Try not to die. We just got here.”&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#nubina">Nubina</a> then strides into <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#the-jungle">the jungle</a>, and within three steps, she disappears from their sight.</p><p><a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#danan">Danan</a> turns towards <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#jain">Jain</a>, smirking. “You like her.”</p><p>“Shut up.” <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#jain">Jain</a> tries to hide his blushing face.</p></div></div></div></div>
