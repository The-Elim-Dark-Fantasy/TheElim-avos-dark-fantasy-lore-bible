The wagon's wooden wheels slip and slide over small boulders of well-packed stone. The stone-faced mercenaries of the liberation regiment march alongside the burdened convoy. </p><p>“Fuck, it’s grim,” grumbles <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#the-ox">the Ox</a>, his massive boots sinking into a deep puddle of sloppy muck.</p><p>“Quit your whining. It’s better than dying in the pits,” <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#captain-jorge">Captain Jorge</a> retorts, weary, his frustration clear on his face. A chorus of support ripples through the ranks of the pit fighters.</p><p>“Anything’s better than the pit. We’re freemen,” remarks a liberation soldier, picking at his teeth.</p><p>“We ain’t freemen, you fucking fool.” <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#captain-jorge">Captain Jorge</a> spits out a wad of phlegm from the wagon. “If it ain’t a blade in the pit, it’s going to be some <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#galt">Galt</a> cunt with a blade.”</p><p>“Ain’t no <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#galt">Galt</a> that good with a blade,” chimes in another marching soldier. “Ain’t no <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#galt">Galt</a> good for anything.”</p><p>“I heard them <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#galt">Galt</a> lasses are game for anything, but I ain’t going near any ginger muff.” <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#the-ox">The Ox</a> sneers.</p><p>“More for us then, Ox.”</p><p>“You little man? You ain’t got a cock big enough to hold in your hand.”</p><p>“Not all of us got cocks like bludgeons.”</p><p>“Like I said, ‘little man’.”</p><p>"Alright, lads, I’ve got a splitting headache.” <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#captain-jorge">Captain Jorge</a> rubs his temples. “Twenty-five fucking great cycles; I’ve waited to get out of that pit.” Jorge pops the cork of a flask with his teeth and takes a swig. He passes it down to <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#the-ox">the Ox</a> trudging alongside the wagon. “Cold and grim, that’s <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#galt">Galt</a>, but we’ve got a job to do. That’s the price of freedom. We all serve someone.” Jorge sniffs and snorts; his left eye twitches as he oscillates between anger and disappointment.</p><p>The convoy clatters and squelches onward. The wide, muddy lane descends toward a boulder-littered basin lip. Dampness clings to the soldiers’ skin as they emerge into a stony land of gloomy shadows and loose scree. They slip and slide as they navigate the gloomy and lonesome core.</p><p>“Fuck me,” <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#the-ox">the Ox</a> mutters, taking in his dismal, wet surroundings. His eyes peer ahead through the low charcoal rain clouds. “Imagine living in this fucking hole. It’s the edge of the fucking world.”</p><p>“It’s <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#ossan">Ossan</a>. The last eastern outpost.” Jorge lets out a loud sniffle. “Besides, there’s gold in these bloody rocks. Gold for grain. No wonder the <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#galt">Galt</a>’s are miserable cunts. Adal’s got them by the balls. Pay or starve. It must be a rough deal to swallow.”</p><p><a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#the-ox">The Ox</a> emits a low rumble of mirthful laughter and then falls into trudging silence. As the small convoy weaves its way down the stone valley, the colony garrison comes into view, nestled in the looming shadows of the dull stone basin.&nbsp;</p><p>Brigades of Thielian soldiers mingle with Galtish troops, existing in a world of enduring equilibrium and amicable accord. The troops protect the delicate balance of their traded wealth, unloading wagons of grain and reloading them with wooden chests of precious metals.</p><p>“Welcome to <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#ossan">Ossan</a>, lads.” <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#captain-jorge">Captain Jorge</a> halts his horse-drawn wagon.</p><p>“Papers,” a pompous Thielian general demands, looking over the wagon and the soldiers with raised brows. He turns his gaze to Jorge. “State your business.”</p><p>“<a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#captain-jorge">Captain Jorge</a> of the Liberation Regiment" reaches into his jerkin and retrieves a parchment stamped with the royal seal. “King’s business.”</p><p>The general rubs his hands over the wax seal, casting a skeptical glance at Jorge and then at his men. He breaks the blue wax seal and reads, his eyes widening in amazement. He stifles a cough and glances warily back at Jorge and his band of mercenaries. “Well, captain, it seems all is in order.”</p><p>“We’ll need discreet lodgings, general,” Jorge requests, sucking on his gums.</p><p>“There is not much discretion in these orders, captain. You’ll find lodging at the halfway house,” the general replies, his eyes roaming over Jorge and his men. He then turns on his heel. “Tardale Regiment, we need to get out of this fucking pit by nightfall.”</p><p><a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#captain-jorge">Captain Jorge</a> hops down from the wagon and lands in a puddle of mud. He rubs his bald head and then massages his missing eye. “Alright, lads. Let’s get some rest. It’s going to be a busy night.”</p><span >

Forty thousand Thielian soldiers stand in perfect formation. Radiant sunlight dances off their gleaming armor, casting a brilliant glow that mirrors their unwavering allegiance to their homeland.&nbsp;</p><p>The proud sigil of <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#thiel">Thiel</a>, the eagle that conquers the world, adorns every fluttering blue standard. At the forefront of the army are the generals, their crested helmets and intricate eagle breastplates marking them as leaders of the regiment’s men.</p><p>The army is a representation of strength, unity, and purpose, organized into regiments of six hundred men each. The captains oversee the regiments, ensuring a seamless symphony of movement and precision.</p><p>On the flanks of the army, mounted on powerful warhorses, the cavalry awaits, in resplendent armor and adorned with blue-plumed helmets. They are the swift, the relentless, and the embodiments of swift vengeance.</p><p>Soldiers meticulously inspect their weapons, honing blades and testing shields. From the frontline troops to the archers and slingers, all are ready for war.</p><p>Officers shout orders, and soldiers respond in unison. The troops seamlessly transition from line formation to marching wedge. Anticipation, discipline, and camaraderie mingle in the air as the soldiers prepare to embark on their relentless march.</p><p><a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#king-adal">King Adal</a> sits mounted atop a white stallion, his golden armor shining with authority. At his side, <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#lord-commander-torrington">Lord Commander Torrington</a> mirrors his noble presence.</p><p>“So, this is it, aye, Torrington." <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#king-adal">King Adal</a> looks ready to conquer the world.</p><p>“Yes, sire.” Torrington takes a crunching bite of a crisp green apple, then feeds the remaining apple to his stallion from his gold-plated gauntlet.</p><p><a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#king-adal">King Adal</a> nods approvingly, his intense gaze still fixed on the preparations unfolding before them. “Excellent work, Torrington. We stand on the precipice of our greatness with a chance to set right the failings of our fathers.”</p><p>Torrington finishes chomping the apple, a thoughtful expression crossing his proud face. “Indeed, sire. The men are itching for a good fight; let’s hope the <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#galt">Galt</a>’s mount a little challenge.”</p><p><a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#king-adal">King Adal</a>’s conquering eyes meet Torrington’s, an understanding passing between them. “Do what you must. Wipe the <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#galt">Galt</a>’s out, every bloody one of them, and ensure your generals adhere to your orders. Conquer <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#galt">Galt</a>, and it is yours, Torrington.”</p><p>The Lord Commander’s grip tightens on the reins.</p><p>The trumpets sound, and the colossal Thielian war machine takes its first step towards conquering <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#galt">Galt</a>.</p><span >

Their calloused hands grip twenty thousand sharpened blades or crude weapons forged from their own cunning. The air is thick and oppressive, hanging heavy with the putrid stench of raw sewage mingling with the acrid tang of sharpened steel.</p><p>Malevolent shadows dance on the walls. Anger crackles in the air like electricity, a volatile energy poised to be unleashed upon the unsuspecting city above. Each breath they draw carries the weight of their suffering.</p><p>In the depths of their underground sanctuary, they wait with patience, honed through years of oppression. The tunnels murmur with rebellion. Hatred seeps through the megalithic passages, entwining with the swirling dust motes in the dim, flickering light. As unyielding as the stone that encompasses them, the walls of injustice must be dismantled.</p><p><a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#the-beggar-king">The Beggar King</a> stands at the forefront, his vengeful eyes ablaze with the reflection of flickering fire-lit torches carried by the twenty thousand peasants behind him. Silent and seething, a lifetime of servitude and suffering burns within his eyes, fueling an unquenchable hatred. <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#thiel">Thiel</a> will burn, and thousands will perish in the inferno of his righteous fury.</p><span >

A throne crafted from pure gold dominates the room. Its ornate engravings depict cosmic battles, twisted figures, and entwined serpents. Draped in ceremonial vestments of midnight black, <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#cardinal-lehon">Cardinal Lehon</a> kneels before <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#the-black-mage">the Black Mage</a> seated on the throne.</p><p><a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#the-black-mage">The Black Mage</a> wears a horned stag’s mask, carved from waxen bine, with a single sorcerous eye. <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#the-black-mage">The Black Mage</a> raises his arms, and arcane energy surges through the chamber, casting eerie shadows that writhe like living entities. Smoky tendrils of dark devotion are mixed with his whispers of incantations.</p><p><a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#cardinal-lehon">Cardinal Lehon</a> remains bowed, fearful of his masters’ feet.</p><p>The room brims with anticipation, as if the fabric of reality itself quivers under the weight of the mage’s power. The chamber trembles, its walls breathing in rhythm with the mage’s sorcery. Profound darkness steals the light, enveloping the chamber in an impenetrable veil. The room quakes as the insidious Black Mage speaks, his words carrying an incomprehensible weight.</p><p>“It is time.”</p><span >

The white monastery atop the mountain shines in the Great Moon’s light.</p><p>A solitary amber glow cuts through the darkness, casting a warm, flickering light on <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#high-priest-anon">High Priest Anon</a>’s somber face. Seated at his modest wooden desk, he gazes through a slender stone window, peering into the expanse beyond. His slate eyes, etched with fatigue, fixate upon a celestial omen—a nebula owl with crystalline azure eyes, foretelling a time of change. A heavy reflection settles upon Anon’s troubled mind.</p><p>A gentle rap on his chamber door interrupts the High Priest’s reverie. Anon straightens his robes and rises. <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#captain-lorllen">Captain Lorllen</a>, the unwavering guardian of the monastery, stands before him.</p><p>“Riders have arrived at the main gate, Your Holiness. They claim to be dispatched under the orders of <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#lord-varesh">Lord Varesh</a>.” The captain presents Anon with a golden ring bearing <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#lord-varesh">Lord Varesh</a>’s emblem. The parchment is sealed with wax, depicting an eye nestled within a blossoming rose.</p><p>Anon’s sorrowful eyes scan the words inked by <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#lord-varesh">Lord Varesh</a>, his breath catching and his knees faltering.

The once-promising light fades away as the approaching clouds devour it. Amidst the tumultuous sky, a celestial symphony unfolds as bolts of lightning illuminate a new ethereal figure of a bright nebula owl. Cloaked in cosmic radiance, the owl’s form shimmers with iridescent hues. The nebula owl soars through the turmoil above, a vigilant guardian amidst the encroaching shadows that blanket the lands of <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#galt">Galt</a>.</p><p>The horse-drawn cart presses onward, braving the biting onslaught of icy winds as it ventures into the treacherous <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#benguire-mountain-pass">Benguire Mountain pass</a>. The towering peaks, cloaked in a pristine layer of snow, loom above like forbidding sentinels, their jagged edges reaching towards the heavens. The cart’s rickety wheels crunch through the thin blanket of snow, led by the steadfast cob.</p><p><a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#nirtesh">Nirtesh</a> sits with tears streaming down his ancient face, each droplet a testament to the profound sorrow of a father who knows loss. His distraught gaze rises through his tears to see his son’s owl nebula shining in the gathering sky. The nebula’s radiant blue light casts an ethereal glow upon <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#nirtesh">Nirtesh</a>’s path. The divine beacon guides him through the unforgiving, towering mountains.</p><p>The icy winds whip around him, the mournful howls intermingling with <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#nirtesh">Nirtesh</a>’s silent lament. Each step forward carries <a href="https://www.theelim.net/the-darkness-steals-the-light/home#nirtesh">Nirtesh</a> closer to his purpose; through tears and snow, he forges a path through the mountain pass, guided by the eternal illumination of his son’s memory.</p><span >

Their eyes, now fixed on the world of men and tainted by darkness, see a country shrouded in an oppressive veil of shadows. Through their new vision, the world appears devoid of color, an eternal expanse of black and grey, stripped of all vibrancy.</p><p>The weight of suffocation clings to them, an ever-present reminder of their altered state. Tendrils of dense, deathly blackness writhe within, burrowing deep and weaving vile webs of malice and hatred through their flesh. With every breath, they taste the searing tang of blood, the scorching iron, and the putrid decay. Their bodies, once vibrant and alive, are now vessels of decay; the fevered furnaces have been extinguished and replaced with gray-tinged skin.
